Tibbles are a streamlined variation of data frames. 

Tibbles automatically pull up only the first 10 rows of a dataset and only
as many columns as can fit on your screen.
 
Unlike data frames, tibbles maintain the integrity of your variable names
and data types throughout, ensuring consistency in your data.

To put in perspective, standard data frame in `R` is like a `CSV` file whereas
tibbles act like `Parquet` file.

## Load Diamond dataaset

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse) 
data(diamonds)
```

```{r}
View(diamonds)
```

## Create a tibble

Use the function `as_tibble()` to create a tibble from an existing data frame or matrix. 

```{r}
as_tibble(diamonds)
```

We must save the diamonds dataset as a tibble:

```{r}
diamonds_tibble <- as_tibble(diamonds)
```

We can then examine the diamonds tibble:

```{r}
diamonds_tibble
```
